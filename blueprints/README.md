# What is a Blueprint?

A Blueprint is a way to organize your Flask application into distinct modules that can each have their own views, static files, templates, and other resources. This modular approach allows for better code organization and reusability.

# Why Use Blueprints?

Separation of Concerns: Blueprints help to separate different parts of your application logically. For instance, you can have separate blueprints for authentication, admin, user management, etc.

Reusability: You can reuse blueprints across different projects. A blueprint can be packaged and distributed as a separate module.

Maintainability: With blueprints, itâ€™s easier to manage large codebases. Each blueprint can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

Collaborative Development: Multiple developers can work on different blueprints simultaneously without causing conflicts.
